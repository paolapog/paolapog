# Hi there, I'm Paola 👋

## I'm a curious Developer, thirsty to learn something new

- 📚 I'm currently learning NextJS and React Query
- 🔥 I've just started contribute to open source projects
- 🏳️ I strongly prefer FE to BE (sorry not sorry)
- 👩‍🎓 I'm an achievement oriented person
- 🥅 Long term goals: master (aka be *really really good at*) front end technologies and FP languages
- 🏝️ When I'm not coding... I'm travelling around the world, doing sports, playing theatre, reading some articles or spending time with my dearest people
