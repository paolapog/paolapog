# Hi there, I'm Paola 👋

## I'm a curious developer, thirsty to learn something new

- 📚 I'm currently breaking my head with Algorithms and Data Structures
- 🔥 I'm contributing to open source projects (mainly UI Libraries and documentation)
- 👩‍🎓 I'm an achievement oriented person
- 🥅 Long term goals: becoming the supportive and knowledgeable mentor I wished I had during the early stages of my career
- 🏝️ When I'm not coding... I'm travelling around the world (especially for 🏄‍♀️), doing sports, playing videogames, reading some articles or spending time with my dearest people
